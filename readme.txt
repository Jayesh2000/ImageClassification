Kaggle Kernel notebook was used to complete this assignment.
To run the train.py script: 
Open a new kernel with GPU and internet ON and upload the .tar.gz file for train and test namely: 'gnr638_test.tar.gz' and 'gnr_train.tar.gz' as input
run the script to obtain a model file named "saved_model.h5" as its output once you commit it
Download this file
Now to run the test.py script:
Open a new notebook with the same specifications as before
Upload both the .tar.gz file once again and also the 'saved_model.h5' file as input
Run it and then commit it to finally obtain the .csv file as output
